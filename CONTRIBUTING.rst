Testing
-------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please install `tox`_, which is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool.

`tox`_ is available for download from `PyPI`_ via `pip`_::

    $ pip install tox

It will automatically create a fresh virtual environment and install our test dependencies,
such as `pytest-cookies`_ and `flake8`_.

Run the Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tox uses py.test under the hood, hence it supports the same syntax for selecting tests.

For further information please consult the `pytest usage docs`_.

To run all tests using various versions of python in virtualenvs defined in tox.ini, just run tox.::

    $ tox

It is possible to test with a specific version of python. To do this, the command
is::

    $ tox -e py37

This will run py.test with the python3.7 interpreter, for example.

To run a particular test with tox for against your current Python version::

    $ tox -e py -- -k test_default_configuration
